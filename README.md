# Issues

This repo's GitHub Issues tracker is the primary issue tracker for GalliumOS at this time. **This is _not_ a support forum! Please only post issues with GalliumOS itself. We don't care about your specific piece of software that doesn't seem to work for reasons completely unrelated to GalliumOS or the computer that you bricked. Those are not our issues.** If you want support, you should go to the /r/galliumos subreddit, or #galliumos IRC channel. Thank you.
