Before submitting an issue, please do the following.

1. Search for a similar issue in the issue tracker. Duplicate issues are not helpful, and waste everyone's time.
2. Don't ask questions here. This is for problems only. If you have a question, you can ask on reddit or the IRC channel.
3. Try to reproduce the issue, and if you can, give us specific instructions on how to do it.
4. If applicable to your issue, please state your ChromeOS hardware model, if you've flashed firmware, and if you're running a nightly.
5. If you are using GalliumOS 1.0, please upgrade to 2.0 before submitting issues, as GalliumOS 1.0 is no longer supported as of the first of July, 2016.
