Before submitting an issue, please do the following.

1. Search for a similar issue in the issue tracker. Duplicate issues are not helpful, and waste everyone's time.
2. Don't ask questions here. This is for problems only. If you have a question, you can ask on reddit or the IRC channel.
3. Try to reproduce the issue, and if you can, give us specific instructions on how to do it.

Thank you for reporting issues, and helping us keep the issue tracker tidy.
